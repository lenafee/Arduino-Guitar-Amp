# Arduino-Guitar-Amp

## Introduction
This is a small all in one digial amp projekt. This base is an Arduino Uno. The amp is programmeble and you are able to design a hole variety of effects. The hole system can run on batteries and can be includet in nearly every speaker. In my case I addet the amp into an old broken guitar amp but I also tested it with an hifi speaker. The project was inspired by the guitar pedal from Electrosmash.

## Effects
1. Volume
2. Boost
3. Distorsion
  1. Hard Clipping
  2. Soft Clipping

1.  C1, C4, C8 = 100nf
2.  C2, C6, C5, C7 = 6.8nF
3.  C3 = 270pF
4.  R1, R4, R11 = 1MOhm
5.  R2, R3 = 4.5kOhm
8.  R5, R8, R7, R10, R12 = 4.7kOhm
9.  R6 = 100kOhm
10. R9 = 220kOhm
11. P1 = 500k Trimmer
12. K1 = screw terminal block
12. Arduino Prototype Shield
13. Arduino Uno
14. I'm using a adapter power supply. But you can use every 5v power supply with enough power.
15. Class d amp for example XH-M177 PAM8403
