# Arduino-Guitar-Amp

## Introduction
This is a small all in one digial amp projekt. This base is an Arduino Uno. The amp is programmeble and you are able to design a hole variety of effects. The hole system can run on batteries and can be includet in nearly every speaker. In my case I addet the amp into an old broken guitar amp but I also tested it with an hifi speaker. The project was inspired by the guitar pedal from Electrosmash https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield-uno.

## Effects
* Volume
* Boost
* Distorsion
    * Hard Clipping
    * Soft Clipping

*  C1, C4, C8 = 100nf
*  C2, C6, C5, C7 = 6.8nF
*  C3 = 270pF
*  C9, C10 = 4.7uF electrolytic capacitor
*  R1, R4, R11 = 1MOhm
*  R2, R3 = 4.5kOhm
*  R5, R8, R7, R10, R12 = 4.7kOhm
*  R6 = 100kOhm
* R9 = 220kOhm
* P1 = 500k Trimmer
* K1 = screw terminal block
* Arduino Prototype Shield
* Arduino Uno
* I'm using a adapter power supply. But you can use every 5v power supply with enough power.
* Class d amp for example XH-M177 PAM8403
* MCP6002
